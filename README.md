# We-Party

A friend's project he entrusted me to bring to fruition. Upon
deployment, the web app will allow the user to find venues to meet up with
people, create a group based on a few criteria (location, contribution,
size of the group etc..) and be notified as the group is getting closer to
full size. A chat service ( in development ) will then allow the users to convene of a location to meet at.
